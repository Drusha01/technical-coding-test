Hi, Make sure all dependencies packages are included. 

for the database, i modified it slightly to accommodate reference base and joining. you can found it in the this zip file or solutions folder named "db.sql".

this has paginations simple joins and assumes that department table as has a head defaulted to null. 

as I have not yet finish the department module I just manually insert the departments table to accommodate it in the application. 

that's all thank you.
